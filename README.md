User Search Web App
This project is a user search and management web application designed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It utilizes JSONPlaceholder's REST API to fetch user data and display it in a visually organized, searchable format. Key features include:

1. Search Functionality: Allows users to search by name or email, filtering the user list in real time.
2. User Display Cards: Each user appears in a card format with name, email, and ID fields, allowing you to edit or delete users locally.
3. User Address & Details: Address and additional information appear on hover, while a click on the user’s ID toggles a list of the user’s To-Do items.
4. Styling and Interactive Design: Styled with Bootstrap for responsive layout and custom CSS for enhanced interaction, such as hover effects and a light gray background for readability.
This setup makes it a great demonstration of fetching, displaying, and interacting with API data dynamically on the client side.
